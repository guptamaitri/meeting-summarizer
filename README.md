# meeting-summarizer
This is a Python FastAPI implementation to summarize meetings using Gemini API. The program accepts both audio and video recordings of the meeting. Using OpenAI whisper, processes the audio, and outputs an AI generated summary. Alternatively, it also generates insights through text transcriptions of the meeting.
